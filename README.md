Project Overview
This project involves the creation of custom dataset features that have been processed and converted into a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) format. The dataset contains both training and testing data, consolidated into a single file for use in machine learning tasks.

Files in this Repository
1. Random File (train + test data)
The random file contains both the train and test data in one combined dataset. This data has been cleaned, processed, and transformed into a format suitable for further analysis and model building.
It includes custom features created during the feature engineering phase and then reduced using PCA for dimensionality reduction.
2. Dataset Features
Custom Features: These features were created based on domain knowledge and were added to enhance model performance.
PCA Transformation: After feature creation, PCA was applied to reduce dimensionality while retaining the most important variance from the data. The PCA format helps improve model efficiency and performance.
Data Details
Input Data: The original data was split into training and testing sets.
Train Data: The portion of the dataset used for training machine learning models.
Test Data: The portion used to evaluate the performance of the trained model.
The PCA transformation reduces the number of features, helping mitigate overfitting and improving computational efficiency.

How to Use
Load the dataset (random file) into your preferred machine learning environment.
Perform any necessary preprocessing steps.
The dataset is now ready for model training and evaluation.
Dependencies
Python (3.x or higher)
Pandas (For data handling)
Scikit-learn (For PCA and model building)
